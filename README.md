# web-components
This is a prototpe project which is made to understand how communication can happen between web application and web components.
Also between two different web components.This project has functionalities like inserting web components dynamically and setting user inputted attributes to the web component, a delete option which disconnects the web component from the web application.
This project includes two different web components, one of the web components functionality is to get attributes from the web component clicked on the web application and display its particular attributes in a "modal box". This helps us in understanding how to communication between two different web components takes place.
Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Custom components and widgets build on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.
