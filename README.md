Introduction

This is a collection of reusable web components that can be easily integrated into your web projects. Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps.

Features

üöÄ Easy to use: Simply import the component and use it in your HTML.

üåê Cross-browser compatibility: Works in all modern browsers.

üì¶ Lightweight: Small bundle sizes for efficient loading.

üé® Customizable: Style and configure components to fit your project's needs.

üîÑ Reusable: Use components across different projects.

# Getting Started

## Installation

Just load up the code on VScode or any editor, and launch the web application on the browser (go live on vs code).

# About the project:

This prototype project stands as a comprehensive exploration of communication methods between a web application and web components, as well as inter-component communication. It encompasses a wide array of sophisticated features, shedding light on the potential of modern web development:

Dynamic Web Component Integration: One of the project's core functionalities lies in its dynamic web component integration. This innovative capability enables developers to seamlessly inject web components into the web application at runtime. This dynamic insertion empowers designers to create highly interactive and adaptable user interfaces, responding to user needs in real-time.

User-Defined Attributes: At the heart of this project is the ability for users to define and assign attributes to web components. This feature allows for a high degree of personalization, ensuring that these components can be tailored to specific requirements. Users can configure attributes that influence the appearance, behavior, and functionality of these components, offering a deeply customized user experience.

Deletion Option: To maintain the application's agility and flexibility, a deletion option is provided. This feature permits the removal or disconnection of web components from the application. It's a crucial component management tool, offering developers a way to streamline their application by removing unnecessary or outdated components, ensuring optimal performance and maintainability.

Inter-Component Communication: Beyond just web application to component interaction, this project showcases the capabilities of inter-component communication. It introduces two distinct web components, one of which plays a vital role in this communication ecosystem. When a web component is clicked within the application, this specialized component retrieves and displays the attributes of the selected component in a modal box. This illustrates the seamless communication between different web components, opening the door to a plethora of possibilities for building modular and collaborative web applications.

In essence, web components constitute a suite of web platform APIs. These APIs provide developers with the tools to craft custom, reusable, and encapsulated HTML tags. These tags are designed to seamlessly integrate into web pages and applications. They rigorously adhere to the Web Component standards, ensuring cross-browser compatibility. Furthermore, they are versatile and can be seamlessly incorporated into any JavaScript library or framework that operates with HTML, making them a valuable asset for enhancing web-based interfaces.

# Specifications

Web components are based on four main specifications:

## Custom Elements
The Custom Elements specification lays the foundation for designing and using new types of DOM elements.

## Shadow DOM
The shadow DOM specification defines how to use encapsulated style and markup in web components.

## ES Modules
The ES Modules specification defines the inclusion and reuse of JS documents in a standards based, modular, performant way.

## HTML Template
The HTML template element specification defines how to declare fragments of markup that go unused at page load, but can be instantiated later on at runtime.
