Introduction

This is a collection of reusable web components that can be easily integrated into your web projects. Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps.

Features

üöÄ Easy to use: Simply import the component and use it in your HTML.

üåê Cross-browser compatibility: Works in all modern browsers.

üì¶ Lightweight: Small bundle sizes for efficient loading.

üé® Customizable: Style and configure components to fit your project's needs.

üîÑ Reusable: Use components across different projects.

# Getting Started

## Installation

Just load up the code on VScode or any editor, and launch the web application on the browser (go live on vs code).

# About the project:

This prototype project serves as a practical exploration of communication channels between a web application and web components, as well as among distinct web components. It encompasses several pivotal features:

Dynamic Web Component Integration: The project empowers developers to dynamically insert web components into the web application. This dynamic insertion capability is a cornerstone for creating flexible and interactive user interfaces.

User-Defined Attributes: Users have the ability to input and associate attributes with web components. This feature grants users the freedom to personalize these components, enhancing their utility and adaptability.

Deletion Option: To maintain a responsive and adaptable web application, a delete option is available. It enables the detachment of web components from the application, allowing for streamlined management.

This project showcases two unique web components. One of them serves a crucial function: it retrieves attributes from a clicked web component within the web application. Subsequently, it presents these attributes in a modal box. This powerful feature exemplifies how communication can seamlessly occur between disparate web components, enhancing the user experience and expanding the capabilities of web applications.

In essence, web components constitute a suite of web platform APIs. These APIs provide developers with the tools to craft custom, reusable, and encapsulated HTML tags. These tags are designed to seamlessly integrate into web pages and applications. They rigorously adhere to the Web Component standards, ensuring cross-browser compatibility. Furthermore, they are versatile and can be seamlessly incorporated into any JavaScript library or framework that operates with HTML, making them a valuable asset for enhancing web-based interfaces.

# Specifications

Web components are based on four main specifications:

## Custom Elements
The Custom Elements specification lays the foundation for designing and using new types of DOM elements.

## Shadow DOM
The shadow DOM specification defines how to use encapsulated style and markup in web components.

## ES Modules
The ES Modules specification defines the inclusion and reuse of JS documents in a standards based, modular, performant way.

## HTML Template
The HTML template element specification defines how to declare fragments of markup that go unused at page load, but can be instantiated later on at runtime.
